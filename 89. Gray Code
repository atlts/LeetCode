Description:
The gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

Given a non-negative integer n representing the total number of bits in the code, print the sequence of gray code. A gray code sequence must begin with 0.

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: [0,1,3,2]
Explanation:
00 - 0
01 - 1
11 - 3
10 - 2

For a given n, a gray code sequence may not be uniquely defined.
For example, [0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence.

00 - 0
10 - 2
11 - 3
01 - 1

Solution:
According to how to know how many 1s does a numnber have,we can understand why ther is just one different bit between i and (i+1)
Assume i != j then there is at least one different bit between them, if i = xxxx1yyyy,j = xxxx0yyyy.i/2 = zxxxx1yyy ,j/2 = zxxxx1yyy.Then at where i is different from j,
for (i ^ i>> 1) it will become (1^xï¼‰,and for (j ^ j >> 1) it will become(0^x),so (i^(i/2)) != (j^(j/2)).

class Solution {
   public List<Integer> grayCode(int n) {
    List<Integer> result = new LinkedList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < 1<<n; i++) result.add(i ^ i>>1);
    return result;
}
}
